# Code

#Sum Range Query is search operation to find the cumulative value stored at indexices using Binary Index Tree or Fenwick Tree.

#R-Tree have a nearest neighbour querying than Quad Trees but slower spatial index creation, examples are to create virtual maps and to store geospatial coordinates due to its multidimensional properties. 

#Dikjstra's Algorithm is used to find the shortest distance between a vertex and other vertices in a weighted graph. Fibonacci Heap is used to optimize the algorithm to find the best insertion position sequentially.
