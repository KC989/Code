# Code

#Sum Range Query is search operation to find the cumulative value stored at indexices using Binary Index Tree or Fenwick Tree.

#R-Tree have a nearest neighbour querying than Quad Trees but slower spatial index creation, examples are to create virtual maps and to store geospatial coordinates due to its multidimensional properties. 

#Dikjstra's Algorithm is used to find the shortest distance between a vertex and other vertices in a weighted graph. Fibonacci Heap is used to optimize the algorithm to find the best insertion position sequentially. 

#KD Alogrithm is a space partioning set in a k-dimensional set. KD Algorithm is useful in searches invloving a multidimensional search key. KD Trees are a special way of partioning binary space partioning trees. 

#Trie is a kind of n-ary tree structure for storing and searching a specific key from a set.

#Sum of Range of Query in Segment Tree. I chose Segment Tree because it is more powerful than a fenwick tree as a fenwick tree can calcualte prefix sums, and segment tree can calculate on any sub segment.
